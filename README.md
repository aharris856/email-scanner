# email-scanner
**JUST GOT IT WORKING WITH PROPER JAR/DEPENDENSIES (mail.jar and activation.jar)!**
I am currently working to figure out how to read an email and attachments within.
This repository has some of what I am working to learn. This will not funciton without
certain referenced libraries and jar files that I have in my actual IDE project.
